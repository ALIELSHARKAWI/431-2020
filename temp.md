Welcome! PQHS 431 is the first part of a two-semester sequence (PQHS 431-432) taught by Professor Thomas Love in the Department of Population and Quantitative Health Sciences at Case Western Reserve University.

## Pep Talk! (Thanks, [Andrew Heiss](https://evalf19.classes.andrewheiss.com/syllabus/#pep-talk))

Learning R can be difficult at first - it’s like learning a new lanugage, just like Spanish, French, or Chinese. Hadley Wickham—the chief scientist at RStudio and the author of some amazing R packages you’ll be using like `ggplot2` [made this wise observation](https://r-posts.com/advice-to-young-and-old-programmers-a-conversation-with-hadley-wickham/):

> It’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.

If you’re finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head against a wall and not understanding, take a break, talk to classmates, ask questions at `431-help at case dot edu`, e-mail Dr. Love, etc.

I promise you can do this.
