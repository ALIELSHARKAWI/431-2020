    - Complete a careful skim (at least) of the [Course Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2020-syllabus/).
    - Read the Introduction and Sections 1-3 of Jeffrey Leek's *The Elements of Data Analytic Style*
    - Install [R and R Studio](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/software_install.html) on your computer, then install the [R packages](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/r_packages.html) on this list so that you're ready to start doing work in R as quickly as possible.
- Your first substantial assignment is [Lab 01](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/labs/lab01/lab01.md), due on **2020-09-07**.
    - In order to complete Lab 01, you'll need to have read the Introduction to David Spiegelhalter's *The Art of Statistics*
    - You should be able to complete Parts 1-3 of Lab 01 now, and Part 4 will be possible on 2020-09-01.
