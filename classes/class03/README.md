## Getting Help

- Many things you need to know are in the [Course Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2020-syllabus/). 
    - I have a way of knowing whether you've read the whole thing or not, and you'll know how I know that, too, if you do so. I know it's very long.
- If you have questions outside of class time, please post them to [Piazza](https://piazza.com/case/fall2020/pqhs431), which is open now.
- If you'd like some one-on-one assistance, Teaching Assistant Office Hours began on Monday 2020-08-31.
    - The schedule and zoom links are available in the Announcements section of [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu).

## Next Deliverables

- Minute Paper after Class 03 to be announced and discussed
- Lab 01 deadline - see the [Calendar] for all deadlines.
    - Part 4 of the Lab will be possible after today's class.
