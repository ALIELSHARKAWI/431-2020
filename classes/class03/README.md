## Getting Help

- Many things you need to know are in the [Course Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2020-syllabus/). 
- If you have questions outside of class time, please post them to [Piazza](https://piazza.com/case/fall2020/pqhs431), which is open now.

### TA Office Hours

- If you'd like some one-on-one assistance, Teaching Assistant Office Hours began on Monday 2020-08-31.
    - Office Hours are held for your benefit. Please visit the TAs, especially if you have questions about how to do things in R, or about the content of the class slides or course notes. Most of them are volunteering their time to help you, and most of them have been in your shoes in previous years.
    - I'll mention here that I'm delighted that Amr Mahran is also joining us as a TA this Fall, and Amr's information is now part of our Syllabus.
- The Zoom links for all TA office hours are now available in the Announcements section of [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu). I'll repeat the schedule here, and it's also on the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/calendar.html).

## What Should I Be Working On?

1. Please complete the [Minute Paper after Class 03](http://bit.ly/431-2020-minute-03) by Noon **tomorrow** (Wed 2020-09-02). 
    - This involves completing a Google Form at http://bit.ly/431-2020-minute-03: be sure to log into Google via your CWRU account to see the form.
    - The [general page for Minute Papers](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/minutepapers/README.md) is here. Get used to doing these on Tuesdays after class. They are **the main part** of your Class Participation grade.
    - You should complete all of these Minute Papers this semester, regardless of whether you've seen the most recent class (in this case, Class 03) yet.
2. Thanks to Clara Harb, Derrick Liu, Jill Miracle, Will Patterson, Maggie Rybak, Amir Sadri, Sam Waddell, Mia Wang, Emily Zetzer and Michael Zhang for proving to me that they have read all of the [Course Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2020-syllabus/) (as of 2020-08-31 at 10:30 PM). I hope you all will do this very soon.
3. The following students have not yet accepted the invitation to join the Piazza class discussion forum as of 2020-08-31 at 10:30 PM. 
    - Check your preferred email's junk/spam folder for the invitation from me through Piazza and get this resolved, please.
        - Asma Almijlad, Akif Gormez, Jane Hinkle, Natasha Ingles, Jeff Kovach, Joe Magoline, 
        - Aman Pande, Lindsay Petrenchik, Charlotte Ren, Deja Rose, Zoe Sekyonda, Sarah Simmons, 
        - Ananya Subramaniam, Long Vu, Kiara White, Modong Yang and Wail Yar 
4. Continue to make progress on [Lab 01](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/labs/lab01/lab01.md), due 2020-09-07. 
    - You should be able to complete all four parts as soon as Dr. Love opens up the [Survey for Lab 01](http://bit.ly/431-2020-lab01-survey) at http://bit.ly/431-2020-lab01-survey. 
    - Note that the survey for Lab 01 is DIFFERENT than the [Minute Paper after Class 03](http://bit.ly/431-2020-minute-03), which is at http://bit.ly/431-2020-lab01-survey.

## Announcements

1. The [Main Class Website](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/) now links to new material on [R Tutorials](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/software/README.md).
2. Names shared by two people in this class include: Ali, Emily, Joe, Lindsay and Michael. I'll try to avoid confusion.
3. New Data Sets are available at [our Data page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-data)
    - I've updated the age guesses from the 10 photos we looked at in Class 01, and that's in the [photo-age-history-2020.csv](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-data/blob/master/photo-age-history-2020.csv) file.
    - I've updated the "simple" survey we did in Class 02, and that's in the [surveyday1_2020.csv](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-data/blob/master/surveyday1_2020.csv) file.
