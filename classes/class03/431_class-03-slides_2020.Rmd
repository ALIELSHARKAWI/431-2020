## Today's Agenda

1. R, RStudio, R Packages and R Markdown
2. "Live" Demo: The "Short" Survey

## Everything R

1. **R** is a computer language designed primarily for statistical computing and graphics. We use R to make sense of data.
2. **RStudio** is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It includes a console, editor and tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management. We use RStudio to control our R experience. 
3. **R Packages** are collections of functions and code to help expand what base R can do. A key set of packages for doing data science in a coherent and enjoyable way are collectively known as the tidyverse.
    - We **install** packages (and occasionally update them) on our computer as if they were apps on our phone.
    - We then **load** packages within our R code to use those functions in our work.
4. **R Markdown** is a file format to help us make dynamic documents with R. An R Markdown file ends with .Rmd and is an easy-to-write plain text format containing chunks of embedded R code. Everything we'll build in 431, including our reports, labs, presentation slides, etc., will come from R Markdown.

## Chatfield's Six Rules for Data Analysis

1. Do not attempt to analyze the data until you understand what is being measured and why.
2. Find out how the data were collected.
3. Look at the structure of the data.
4. Carefully examine the data in an exploratory way, before attempting a more sophisticated analysis.
5. Use your common sense at all times.
6. Report the results in a clear, self-explanatory way.

## Data Science

## What We'll Do In The Live Demo

1. Create a directory called `431-class-03-demo-live` on our computer.
2. Download the data and 431-r-template.Rmd files to that folder from Github.
3. Open RStudio (we'll assume a successful installation) and briefly tour the four main windows.
4. Start a new R Project to do our work, linked to our chosen directory.
5. Use the template to start our R Markdown file.
6. Write code to do things in R with the data.
7. Write in English to explain the analyses that we're doing.
8. "Knit" together the R Markdown file to produce an attractive result in HTML.
9. Share the HTML result so that we can all see it.

## A Worked "Short" Survey Analysis (`431_class-03-demo-full`)

We have updated data on the site in a file called `surveyday1_2020.csv`. 

`431_class-03-demo-full` R Markdown file, used to build HTML (and PDF) results.

- Key verbs in the tidyverse for data wrangling
  - select, filter, count, arrange, mutate, group_by, summarize
- Visualizing a single quantitative variable
- Comparing a distribution of a quantity within groups
  - Faceted histogram
  - Comparison boxplot
- Obtaining numerical summaries
- Scatterplots to describe associations

## Suppose we start from here...

```{r}
library(magrittr); library(tidyverse)
```

## and here...

```{r}
day1 <- read_csv("surveyday1_2020.csv")
```

## Analyzing the Survey Data

```{r}
mosaic::favstats(~ height.in, data = day1)
```

## Analyzing the Survey Data - A little challenge

Can you reproduce the following...

## A. That fill color is called *salmon*, I used 20 bins.

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
day1 %>% filter(complete.cases(pulse)) %>%
  ggplot(data = ., aes(x = pulse)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, col = "blue", fill = "salmon") +
  labs(x = "Height (inches) of Students in 431", 
       y = "# of Students",
       title = "Heights of 378 students in 431",
       subtitle = "4 students had missing heights")
```

## Code for Part A.

```{r, eval = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
day1 %>% filter(complete.cases(pulse)) %>%
  ggplot(data = ., aes(x = pulse)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, col = "blue", fill = "salmon") +
  labs(x = "Height (inches) of Students in 431", 
       y = "# of Students",
       title = "Heights of 378 students in 431",
       subtitle = "4 students had missing heights")
```

## B. Histograms of Heights, Faceted by Year (binwidth = 1 inch)

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
day1 %>% filter(complete.cases(height.in)) %>%
  ggplot(data = ., aes(x = height.in, fill = year)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, col = "white") + 
  facet_wrap(~ year) +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Student Height, by Year")
```

## Code for Plot B.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
day1 %>% filter(complete.cases(height.in)) %>%
  ggplot(data = ., aes(x = height.in, fill = year)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, col = "white") + 
  facet_wrap(~ year) +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Student Height, by Year")
```


## C. Boxplots of Age Guesses, by Year

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
day1 %>% filter(complete.cases(height.in)) %>%
  ggplot(data = ., aes(x = factor(year), y = height.in, 
                    fill = factor(year))) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Student Height, by Year")
```

## Code for Plot C

```{r , eval = FALSE}
day1 %>% filter(complete.cases(height.in)) %>%
  ggplot(data = ., aes(x = factor(year), y = height.in, 
                    fill = factor(year))) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Student Height, by Year")
```

## Table summarizing Student Heights, by Year

```{r}
library(knitr)
mosaic::favstats(height.in ~ year, data = day1) %>%
  kable(digits = 1)
```
