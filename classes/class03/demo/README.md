# 431 Class 03 Demo Materials

- [`431-r-template.Rmd`](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/classes/class03/demo/431-r-template.Rmd): an R Markdown file that contains the basic elements that we'll use to get started. Be sure to click **Raw** and then download the result, in order to have the file show up on your computer properly.

which is all I'll use to start.
