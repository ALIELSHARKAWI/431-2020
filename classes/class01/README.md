# 431 Class 01: 2020-08-25

This is the README for Class 01 of Professor Love's 431 course for Fall 2020.

## How do I get to this README page?

The main website for this class is https://thomaselove.github.io/431/. 

Get here by selecting [Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/calendar.html) from the main website, and then select today's class ([Class 01: 2020-08-25](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/classes/class01)).

## How do I watch the recording?

If you are enrolled in the class, the recording of today's class will appear (when available) in the [Zoom folder on Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu)

## Today's Materials

1. We'll start today on [the main page](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/) for the course, and look over:

- the [Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2020-syllabus/)
- the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-notes/) (main text for the course)
- the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/calendar.html), which is the final word for all deadlines in this course
- the Assignments, including the [first Lab](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/labs/lab01/lab01.md)
- the information available on [getting R and R Studio](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/software_install.html) and some [R packages](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/r_packages.html) installed on your computer, as well as some of [the data we'll be using](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/data_index.html).
- the [Piazza discussion forum](https://piazza.com/case/fall2020/pqhs431) for the class, and other ways you can get help from us
    - [Piazza](https://piazza.com/case/fall2020/pqhs431) is the best place to ask (and answer) questions outside of class time, especially before TA office hours begin on 2020-08-31.
- the [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/) page for the course
    - We use [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/) as a place to: set up and store Zoom class recordings, maintain the TA office hours Zoom schedule, and turn in assignments. That's it.

While virtually all of the information in [the Pre-Class Website](https://431-2020-preclass-love.netlify.app/) is still correct, we've started the class now, so it's no longer relevant and will not be updated further.

2. Thank you for completing the [Welcome to 431 Survey](https://bit.ly/431-2020-welcome-survey). Dr. Love's [summary of the results is here](http://bit.ly/431-2020-welcome-results).
