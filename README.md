# 431-2020

This may be the main public repository for the 431 course (PQHS 431, CRSP 431 or MPHP 431) to be led in Fall 2020 by Professor Thomas E. Love at Case Western Reserve University. I'm working out how I might build the site this year, and this repository may disappear, or grow.

Extensive materials will appear here between now and the start of the course on 2020-08-25. A draft [course calendar is available](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/calendar.md). The class will be offered remotely, using the Zoom platform. 

Our class discussion board is found at https://piazza.com/case/fall2020/pqhs431/home. Go there to get started asking questions and get help from our TAs and Dr. Love.

Prior to the class, contact Dr. Love at `thomas dot love at case dot edu` if you have any questions.
